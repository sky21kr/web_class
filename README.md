## To Die For
### 샘 스미스  
It is if everyone dies alone  
Does that scare you?  
I don't wanna be alone

I look for you  
Every day, every night  
I close my eyes  
From the fear, from the light  

As I wander down the avenue, so confused  
Guess I'll try and force a smile  

Pink lemonade sippin' on a Sunday  
Couples holding hands on a runway  
They're all posing in a picture frame  
Whilst my world's crashing down  
Solo shadow on a sidewalk  
Just want somebody to die for  

Sunshine livin' on a perfect day  
While my world's crashing down  
I just want somebody to die for  
I long for you  
Just a touch (does that scare you?)  
Of your hand  
You don't leave my mind  
Lonely days, I'm feeling  
Like a fool for dreaming  

As I wander down the avenue, so confused  
Guess I'll try and force a smile  

Pink lemonade sippin' on a Sunday  
Couples holding hands on a runway  
They're all posing in a picture frame  
Whilst my world's crashing down  
Solo shadow on a sidewalk  
Just want somebody to die for  
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day  
While my world's crashing down  
I just want somebody to die for  

I just want somebody to die for (to die for)  
I just want somebody to die for  
(Does that scare you?)  
(I don't wanna be alone)  

Pink lemonade sippin' on a Sunday  
Couples holding hands on a runway (oh)  
They're all posing in a picture frame  
Whilst my world's crashing down  
Solo shadow on a sidewalk  
Just want somebody to die for  
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day  
While my world's crashing down  
I just want somebody to die for  

I just want somebody to die for (to die for)
